              Eureka Tower is named after the Eureka Stockade, a rebellion during 
              the Victorian gold rush in 1854. This has been incorporated into the 
              design, with the building's gold crown representing the gold rush and a 
              red stripe representing the blood spilt during the revolt. The blue glass cladding

              flag and the white lines also represent the Eureka Stockade flag. The white horizontal

              The market was established in the late 1860s to serve as both a wholesale and retail market for the 
              rapidly growing population of the city of Melbourne. The centrally located Queen Victoria 
              Market replaced a number of smaller markets situated in different parts of the city. 
              The site was developed in stages from 1867 through to 1936 when the site was fully developed. 
              Throughout the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, the market has undergone minor 
              expansions and upgrades.

              The period in which the Victorian government was led by the Premier Sir Rupert Hamer (1972â€“1981) 
              was one of policy development for museums in Victoria. The new Melbourne Museum is 
              located on the site of the former Melbourne Exhibition Speedway which operated 
              from 5 November 1928 until 7 March 1936.

              Melbourne museum is a rich response to Melbourne's urban condition, and provides a place

              The line was opened in 1900 to serve the local farming and timber community. 
              It originally ran from Upper Ferntree Gully station, the terminus of the broad gauge 
              line from Melbourne and now part of Melbourne's suburban railway system,

              The railway was originally one of five narrow gauge lines of the Victorian

              and with a post-preservation history spanning over 50 years, the line is one of the 
              most popular steam heritage railways in the world,[1] and attracts tourists

              In the early years of Melbourne, the Yarra River and the other creeks of Melbourne were 
              used for bathing and for drinking water. By the 1850s, however, the Yarra was becoming 
              quite polluted, though people continued to bathe in it and drink the water. Until 
              the 1850s, sea bathing was not generally considered acceptable.
              The St Kilda Sea Baths were opened in 1860, and provided separate sections for men and women.
              The St Kilda Foreshore Committee was created in 1906, charged with 
              overseeing improvements and bringing some organisation to the neglected 
              foreshore from West Beach, South Melbourne, to Point Ormond.

              The Great Ocean Road was first planned towards the end of World War I, 
              when chairman of the Country Roads Board, William Calder, asked the State War Council 
              for funds to be provided for returned soldiers to work on roads in sparsely populated 
              areas in the Western District. 
              In 1918, the Great Ocean Road Trust was formed as a private company, under the helm 
              of president Howard Hitchcock. The company managed to secure Â£81,000 in capital from private 
              subscription and borrowing, with Hitchcock himself contributing Â£3000.

              An allotment of scrubland to the north-east of Melbourne was selected as Port Phillips 
              first permanent gaol. On 1 January 1838, George Wintle was appointed to be gaoler 
              at the prison at Â£100 a year; with the site becoming colloquially known as Wintle's Hotel. 
              Construction of the gaol started in 1839â€“1840 on Collins Street West, but 
              it was considered too small at the time. A second gaol was then built between 
              1841 and 1844 at the corner of Russell and La Trobe Streets, adjoining the 
              then Supreme Court. The first cell block was opened for prisoners in 1845, 
              but the facilities were considered inadequate; escapes occurring frequently. 
              The gaol was already crowded by 1850.
